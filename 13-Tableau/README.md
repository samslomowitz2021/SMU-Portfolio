# Call to Action

Subscribers or Annual Members outnumber Customer or short-term users. 
Unknown gender users outnumber male and female genders overall. 
Users with an age of 49 outnumber other birth years while Customers 
or short-term users have an larger average trip duration. 
Most of the bikers start in lower Manhattan.
All users return bikes at Lat 40 and Long -73.
My call to action is to target users younger than 50
such as millennials in ad campaigns and group discounts.
