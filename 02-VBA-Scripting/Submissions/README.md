# Call-to-Action

My call to action is to purchase the BRK.A stock as the most recent data (2016) gives it the highest yearly change, which measures increased value in terms of dollars not percentage. You can have a great percentage change in price even with low prices. In essence, it is a within metric that is poor when comparing between groups. In addition, the 2014 data lists BRK.A stock as having the greatest yearly change as well. Thus, purchasing a BRK.A stock will ensure that one can sell the stock at yearâ€™s end with a gain.
